Studies and Experiences
==================

ðŸŽ“ **Highschool** <br>

- My high school was Cemi do Cruzeiro (DF - BrasÃ­lia), where I took an integrated IT course.
- After learning many concepts about technology, I focused on what I liked most, which helped me become the developer I am today.
- Most of what I know today, its because of that time. It's not just about what I learned in school, but also what I was doing outside it.
